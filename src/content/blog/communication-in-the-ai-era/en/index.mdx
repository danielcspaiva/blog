## TL;DR

Clear, contextual communication is the multiplier for both humans and AIs. Include **goal**, **success criteria**, **steps tried**, **environment/constraints**, **artifacts/links**, and a **specific ask**. **Why this matters:** it reduces back and forth, cuts rework, and makes outputs more reliable.

## Introduction

I've [previously argued that English is the ultimate skill](/en/blog/english-is-the-ultimate-skill/). I still believe English is incredibly important, but it’s ultimately a tool for something broader I underplayed last time: **communication**.

If you work with teammates or AI models, this applies to you.

Today, I’m sharing how AI fits into that equation, and why effective communication becomes even more critical in the AI era.

## The human-to-human problem

We’ve all been there: you hit a problem you can’t solve and ask for help. A friend, colleague, forum, chat, or search engine comes back with follow-up questions like:

> What version are you on?  
> Have you read the docs?  
> What did you try?     
> Have you tried this fix?

That’s **context**, and most of the time it’s impossible to help without it.

In my day-to-day, I often get messages like “that thing didn’t work” or “there was a problem.” To actually help, I ask several follow-up questions, and it can take a while for the full picture to emerge.

**All those follow-up questions are the tax we pay for weak context.**

Why this happens:

- We don’t yet fully understand the situation.
- We underestimate how essential those “minor” details are to the person (or system) trying to help.
- We’re just lazy sometimes (myself included 😅).

## The human-to-AI problem

Many people still approach LLMs like Google with a chat interface. They aren't: LLMs are **probabilistic assistants** that generate answers from patterns, not a live, omniscient database.

I recently saw this tweet from Thorsten Ball that summarized it well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I find endlessly fascinating:<br /><br />Some engineers really can&#39;t seem to grasp that LLMs are non-deterministic and how to build software taking that into account.<br /><br />For others it immediately clicked, but for some it seems like there&#39;s a real mental barrier to accept it.</p>&mdash; Thorsten Ball (@thorstenball) <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/1956017792484040731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here are some concepts that are not intuitive but are very important to understand:
- LLM outputs are **nondeterministic**: the same question can return different answers, since models work on probabilities rather than fixed rules.
- Models have **knowledge cutoffs**: they only know about facts, events, and technologies up to the date they were trained. They cannot access real-time information or recent developments.
- They can **hallucinate**: generating responses that don’t correspond to reality.

Tools and MCPs can extend their capabilities, but we need to point the model to the right tools and explain why and how to use them.

Because of this, vague prompts underperform. Treat the model like a collaborator: state your goal, success criteria, relevant context (environment, constraints), what you've tried, and link to artifacts. Do this and quality and reliability go up quickly.

Understanding these basic LLM behaviors changes how you interact with them. You become more careful about providing context, checking outputs, and structuring your prompts better. This makes all the difference in response quality and your overall AI experience.

## A concrete before → after

**Before (poor context):**  
> “Vercel deploy failed. Help!”

**After (good context, short):**  
> **Goal:** Get production build passing again.  
> **Symptom:** Deploys fail on Vercel since commit `b7c9d1e`, error: `Module not found: '@/components/Button'`.  
> **Env:** Next.js 14, Node 20, Vercel build image `2025.07`.  
> **Tried:** Cleared `.next` + `.vercel`, redeployed twice, confirmed local build works.  
> **Links:** Failing build log [link], commit `b7c9d1e`.  
> **Ask:** Identify cause (path alias vs case-sensitive import?) and suggest fix or rollback.

Notice how the improved version defines a clear goal, names the exact error, shows what was tried, and links evidence. That context makes the issue solvable without extra back and forth.

### Quick comparison

| Aspect          | Weak prompt                     | Context-rich prompt                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clarity         | “Deploy failed”                 | Explicit error + failing commit                             |
| Evidence        | None                            | Build log + steps tried                                     |
| Likely outcome  | More follow-ups, wasted cycles  | Targeted diagnosis, actionable next step                    |

## Context engineering is just good communication

Clarity and detail consistently produce better results. When you describe exactly what you’re trying to do, what happened, and what you’ve already attempted, both humans and AI can help you far more effectively than if you only say something went wrong.

Tobi Lütke, CEO of Shopify, puts it well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really like the term "context engineering" over prompt engineering. <br /><br />It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.</p>&mdash; tobi lutke (@tobi) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In practice, “context engineering” is just excellent communication applied to AI: **give the model everything a competent teammate would need to succeed.**

## Conclusion

In the AI era, communicating context clearly is no longer optional, it’s the foundation for consistent results. As Guillermo Rauch, CEO of Vercel, put it, success increasingly depends on the quality of your thinking:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine success being determined purely based on the quality of your thoughts. That's the promise of AI</p>&mdash; Guillermo Rauch (@rauchg) <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1956356467898114443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At the end of the day, communicating well is thinking well — and thinking well is the greatest competitive advantage you can have. **Clear context multiplies results.**
