## Introduction

English has been a transformative force in my life, opening doors I never thought possible. It enabled me to attend UIUC, one of the world's premier universities, and connected me with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds across the globe.

All of this is incredible, but for me, the most important impact is the difference it makes in my daily life. The ability to access and comprehend English-language forums, discussions, documentation, videos, podcasts, and academic papers has fundamentally shaped who I am today.

For those of us from non-English speaking countries, particularly those aspiring to work in tech, English isn't just another skill—it's the most crucial one you can acquire, and learning it will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

## Motivation

A recent interaction with a teammate inspired this post. While troubleshooting a problem, I naturally searched for solutions in English, as I always do. Then my colleague asked:

> Why are you searching on Google in English?

That question made me realize that while this is natural to me, it wasn't obvious to him. So I decided to explain why I consider English proficiency a crucial skill today.

Researching for this post, I discovered that [fewer than 1% of Brazilians are fluent in English](https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/), and Brazil ranks 81st among 111 countries surveyed, and only 18th in Latin America.

While this might offer a competitive edge in the local market, I firmly believe that mastering English is essential for anyone aiming to succeed in tech or any specialized field.

In the global market, speaking English isn't a differentiator—it's the minimum requirement to be competitive.

## How Knowledge Works

Historically, knowledge spread slowly through physical media like books, newspapers, and magazines, with important works being translated to make information accessible across language barriers.

However, the internet has revolutionized this dynamic, creating an environment where information flows in real-time. In rapidly evolving fields where new ideas are constantly emerging, people need to share their discoveries quickly and efficiently.

This necessity has led to the natural convergence toward a common language: **English**.

In any field requiring technical expertise, you'll find that the most influential voices communicate in English—not because they're all native speakers, but because English has become the global lingua franca.

This isn't a new phenomenon; academia has used English as its primary language for centuries. The reality is that the top 10% of experts in any field communicate in English, and those who don't speak the language find themselves at a significant disadvantage.

## Content Acquisition Channels

In the world of startups and entrepreneurship, customer acquisition channels are a common topic of discussion. We all recognize their importance and constantly strive to optimize both their quantity and quality.

Now, let's shift our perspective from customers to information.

> Can you imagine a world where you lack access to the best information channels?

That is precisely the predicament non-English speakers face. When you speak English, you gain the ability to access and curate the most effective channels for staying updated.

## The Concept of "Content Wrappers"

I've noticed a recurring pattern in how information crosses language barriers, which I refer to as "content wrappers".

When a new breakthrough, idea, or technology arises, it is first discussed on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), forums, GitHub, YouTube, and English-language news outlets.

Some time later, this information is "wrapped" and presented in Portuguese by Brazilian news sites or influencers, often with significantly less depth and nuance than the original content.

By relying solely on content wrappers, non-English speakers miss out on three critical aspects:

- **Timing**: You are always late to the party.
- **Depth**: You never get the full picture.
- **Participation**: You are not part of the conversation.

## How Did I Learn English?

My journey to English proficiency was driven by pure curiosity and diverse interests (and a bit of ADHD). Throughout my life, I've explored various hobbies including music, gaming, guitar, piano, 3D printing, filmmaking, and technology.

I quickly realized that to truly delve deep into these interests and satisfy my curiosity, English was essential. I was fortunate to have a supportive family and access to English education in school, which significantly facilitated this learning journey.

## How I Use English

In the software development world, English proficiency isn't just an advantage—it's a fundamental requirement. The entire ecosystem is built around English, from programming languages themselves to documentation, tutorials, and academic papers. The best resources, job opportunities, conferences, meetups, podcasts, and books are predominantly in English.

English has become an essential part of my daily information-seeking process. I instinctively conduct all my searches in English, not just out of habit, but as a deliberate strategy.

When we compare the numbers, the difference is staggering: Portuguese has approximately 260 million speakers, while English reaches 1.46 billion people worldwide. This disparity directly translates into the quantity and quality of available information. Even more significant is the fact that the top 10% of experts in any field communicate predominantly in English, concentrating cutting-edge knowledge in this language.

So when I'm asked, "Why are you searching on Google in English?", the answer is evident: searching in Portuguese represents a self-imposed limitation that would deprive me of accessing the most valuable and up-to-date resources available.

Beyond using English for searches, I stay connected to the global landscape by following and interacting with key influencers and experts in my field through platforms like X, YouTube, and LinkedIn. This active participation allows me not only to consume information but also to be part of the global community that shapes the future of my field.

## How to Learn English

Here are my practical recommendations:

- **Immersive consumption**: Watch movies and series in English with English subtitles.
- **Interest-based learning**: Find a niche that you truly care about and immerse yourself in English content about it.
- **Global connections**: Follow the main creators in your field of interest (most of them will probably speak English).
- **Active participation**: Join online communities and participate in discussions, even if initially just by reading.
- **Constant practice**: Speak English whenever possible, even if it's just by yourself.
- **Cultural immersion**: If you get the chance, travel abroad and immerse yourself in the language.
- **Digital tools**: Use apps and online platforms to systematically practice your English.

## Conclusion

Mastering English is not just about learning a language; it's about opening doors to a world of opportunities. Whether you're in tech, academia, or any other field, English is the key to accessing the best resources, connecting with global experts, and staying ahead in your career.

Personally, I attribute a great part of my professional and academic achievements to my ability to speak English. Without this knowledge, many of the opportunities that shaped my path simply wouldn't have been possible.

Start your journey of learning English today. The investment you make in learning English today will continue to yield returns throughout your personal and professional life.
