## Motivation

Recently, I started reflecting on what the people I admire have in common. Generally, they are creative, intelligent, authentic, and not afraid to speak their minds.

What really catches my attention is that they don't seem to be driven by money, fame, or social validation, but by a genuine desire to create, build, transform, and innovate.

It's as if they are all perfectly aligned with what Paulo Coelho calls "personal legend" in [The Alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)).

Another interesting point is that these people share their learnings and projects, whether through a blog, YouTube channel, podcast, newsletter, or X account.

I deeply admire their work and, in comparison, I feel I still have a long way to goâ€”whether in technical terms, communication, or creativity. But I also know they didn't start at the highest level of mastery, and that was never an impediment for them to take the first step.

So, why not follow in the footsteps of these people who inspire me and create a space to share what I learn and build?

## Why now?

Over the years, I have developed deep technical expertise and tackled challenging projects at TC, Qavi, and through personal projects. As a CTO and mentor, I have come to appreciate the importance of sharing my experiences.

This blog will be the platform to document my journey, enhance my communication, and explore new content formats â€“ including the possibility of expanding to YouTube.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find insights and personal experiences about technology, the market, and entrepreneurship. Beyond sharing knowledge, my goal is to sharpen my communication and writing skills, creating a space for meaningful exchange and mutual growth.

Soon, I intend to explore other content formats, increasing my presence on X and broadening the way I connect with like-minded people.

## How can you participate?

You can help me improve the blog by sharing suggestions, criticisms, and feedback. You can leave comments here on the post (just log in with GitHub), or comment when I post on X, LinkedIn, or Instagram.

You can also schedule a call with me [here.](https://cal.com/danielcspaiva/30min)

This is my first post, and I hope it's the first of many more.

Until next time! ðŸ‘‹
